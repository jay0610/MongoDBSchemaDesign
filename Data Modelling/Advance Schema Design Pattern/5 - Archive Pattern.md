The Archive Pattern in MongoDB is a data modeling pattern used to manage historical or less frequently accessed data efficiently. By moving older or infrequently used data to a separate collection or even a separate database, you can keep the primary collection lean, improving query performance and storage management.

### How It Works

The Archive Pattern involves **partitioning data based on its lifecycle**. "Active" data (frequently used) stays in the main collection, while "archived" data (historical or rarely accessed) is stored separately. This separation makes the active collection smaller and more efficient.

### Example: Log Data

Imagine you're building an application that stores log messages. Recent logs are queried frequently, but older logs are mostly kept for record-keeping purposes and rarely accessed.

**Without Archive Pattern:**

```json
[
  { "log_id": 1, "timestamp": "2025-03-15T00:10:00Z", "level": "INFO", "message": "User login successful" },
  { "log_id": 2, "timestamp": "2023-10-10T10:00:00Z", "level": "ERROR", "message": "Database connection timeout" },
  ...
]
```

This bloats the main collection with older logs, slowing down queries for recent data.

**Without Archive Pattern:**

**Active Logs Collection:**

```json
{
  "log_id": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-03-15T00:10:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful"
}
```

**Archived Logs Collection:**

```json
{
  "log_id": 2,
  "timestamp": "2023-10-10T10:00:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Database connection timeout"
}
```
